# Library Management System ðŸ“š
A web-based Library Management System designed using CodeIgniter 3 and MySQL, featuring distinct access levels for regular users and administrators. The system efficiently manages library collections, tracks borrowing transactions, and facilitates CRUD operations for library resources and user data.

# User Access:
- Bibliography Collection Viewing: Users can access a list of available bibliographies, including details such as title, author, and the number of available copies.
- Borrowing Process: Users can view available collections, but to borrow a book, they must request an admin to process the transaction.

# Admin Access:
- CRUD Operations for Bibliography and Collections: Admins have full access to add, edit, and delete bibliographies and their associated collections (books).
- Circulation Transactions: Admins can view and process borrowing requests, select available collections, and track borrowed books.
- Track Book Return: Admins can verify when a borrowed book is returned, updating the system to reflect the bookâ€™s availability for future borrowing.
- Transaction History: Admins can access detailed transaction history to monitor each userâ€™s borrowing activity.
- User Management: Admins can perform CRUD operations (add, update, delete) on user accounts to manage library patrons effectively.

# Key Features:
- Bibliography and Collection Management: Admins have access to manage bibliographies and collections.
- Circulation Management: Admins track and manage book borrowings, returns, and verify transactions.
- User and Transaction Tracking: Admins can access detailed transaction history and manage user accounts.

# Technologies Used:
- Backend: CodeIgniter 3 (PHP Framework)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- Database: MySQL

This project demonstrates my ability to create a fully functional web application with differentiated access for regular users and administrators. It focuses on efficient management of library resources, user interactions, and transactions.
